# Pipeline for app reviews analysis
A large volume of reviews, written in natural language, are registered in the app stores and have the latent desires of app users. The result generated by these steps gives support to the developer to make strategic decisions about new releases since it considers the opinion of a crowd of users. When using new releases, the user feels more involved and satisfied with the process of evolution of the app.
